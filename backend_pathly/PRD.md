# Assignment

## Objective

Build a small, intelligent web application that generates an AI-powered interactive learning map for any topic the user enters.

The goal is to help users explore complex subjects visually and intuitively, transforming broad learning goals into structured, guided journeys.

---

## Task Description

- When a user enters a topic and clicks “Generate Learning Map,” the app should create an organized, interactive roadmap that outlines key areas to learn and illustrates how they connect.
- **Example:**
  - Searching for **"Web Development"** might generate branches like *Frontend*, *Backend*, and *Databases*, with smaller nodes such as *HTML*, *CSS*, *React*, and *APIs*.
  - Searching for **"Gardening"** might include topics like *Soil Basics*, *Plant Types*, *Watering Techniques*, and *Seasonal Care*.

Each node should display:
- A short description **or**
- A few suggested learning resources (articles, videos, or books)

The output should be a visually interactive map, allowing users to expand, hover, or click on nodes to see connected ideas and short learning notes.

---

## Bonus Features (Optional but Impressive)

If time allows, consider adding one or more of the following enhancements:

- **Deeper exploration:** Allow users to click on any node to expand and reveal subtopics or related branches.
- **Learning level filters:** Let users select Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced levels to adjust the map.
- **Exporting:** Enable exporting of the roadmap as a JSON file.
- **Personalization:** Suggest related topics or next learning paths based on user activity.

---

## Guidelines & Expectations

- Focus on code quality, API design, and LLM (Large Language Model) integration approach.
- The UI should be clear and functional – pixel-perfect design is **not required**.
- Keep your code modular, well-commented, and easy to run locally.
- Think like a product builder: **prioritize clarity, usefulness, and maintainability**.

---

## Evaluation Criteria

Submissions will be assessed on:

- Code structure & readability
- API and data design
- Integration logic with AI / LLM
- Documentation clarity
- Overall functionality and product sense

---

## What to Submit

- Deployed app link (e.g., Vercel, Render, etc.)
- Public GitHub repository with frontend and backend code
- `README.md` file including:
  - Setup and run instructions
  - API usage or LLM integration notes
  - Brief explanation of your approach and any trade-offs
